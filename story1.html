    <p>In one screeching summer, the desert became dry and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt, her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color. Looking to a cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. So ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus courageously agreed, helping them both through the tough summer as friends.</p>
